Principal BEP 20 coin: mana 

The idea is to create a system which can mint mana tokens trough NFTs, and do so in a way that would not be hyperinflationary.

Example:
NFT - Mana source of the gods
Qualities...
Name: fountain of Thor
Mint rate: 50 mana/day
Duration: 20 days

You can then use this mana to fight NPCs. NPCs can then drop different kinds of NFTs, including mana sources.
Most importantly, NPCs can drop fighting NFTs, which can be used to gain strength and to be able to beat stronger adversaries.
Stronger opponents have a greater chance of dropping a valuable item.

Fighting will happen once per day at most, since we don't wanna have millions of NFTs flodding the marketplace.
In order to achieve this, fighting NFTs will have stamina that would get drained once the fight happens.

Example:
NFT - Young elf apprentice
Exp: 150
Strength: 400
Defense: 130
Stamina remaning: 100%
