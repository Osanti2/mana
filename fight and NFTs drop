Pseudocode for NFTs minting, based on current inflation/deflation and probabilty of getting a rare item.

NTFs are dropped whenever a fight happens. The stronger the NPC, the higher the chance the NFTs is dropped.
If we wanna have different types of items, then each monster will have different weights.

Formula:
Probability of dropping item: proportional to sum of all item levels. We will have a curve that adjust the item drop based on its rarity.
So there will be a mapping of numbers into item rarity, then a formula will convert rarity into actual fighting stats / mana source stats.

Variables:
Sum_of_levels=sum(levelNFT1+LevelNFT2+levelNFT3+...)

Rarity setting on NFT drop
It will behave as an exponential. Weights to be set in the future.

Function: NFT drop
id= random (1,10000)
