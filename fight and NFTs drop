Pseudocode for NFTs minting, based on current inflation/deflation and probabilty of getting a rare item.

NTFs are dropped whenever a fight happens. The stronger the NPC, the higher the chance the NFTs is dropped.
If we wanna have different types of items, then each monster will have different weights.

Formula:
Probability of dropping item: proportional to sum of all item levels.

Variables:
Sum_of_levels=sum(levelNFT1+LevelNFT2+levelNFT3+...)
Probability_of_dropping_item
